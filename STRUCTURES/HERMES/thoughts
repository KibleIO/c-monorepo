		Header,
		Device_Local,
		Key_Seed_Local,
		Device_Remote,
		Key_Seed_Remote
	];

All endpoints in the system contain a HERMES structure shared with HOST
All HERMES structures are spawned by the HOST

HOST (remote) will provide new HERMES structures; HERMES structures should not be constructed locally


is

char** pp;
char*  p;

pp = new char*;
p  = new char;

*pp = p;

delete pp;

equal to

char** pp;
char*  p;

p  = new char;

pp = (char**)&p;
